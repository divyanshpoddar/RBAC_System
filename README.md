# 🚀 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

A secure and scalable **Flask-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system for managing **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and role-based resource access. This system ensures users are authenticated and authorized based on their roles and permissions.

---

## ✨ **Features**

- 🔒 **Secure Authentication**: 
  - User registration and login with **JWT**.
  - Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** for maximum security.

- 🛡️ **Role-Based Authorization**:
  - Dynamic role assignment (e.g., Admin, User).
  - Access to resources is controlled based on roles and permissions.

- 🧩 **RBAC Implementation**:
  - Roles and permissions stored in the database for scalability.
  - Access restrictions enforced via decorators.

- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**:
  - Clean separation of concerns across routes, models, and utilities.

## ⚙️ **Requirements**

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 🌐 Flask 2.0+
- 🔑 Flask-JWT-Extended
- 🔒 Flask-Bcrypt
- 🗂️ Flask-SQLAlchemy
- 🚀 Flask-Migrate
- 💾 SQLite or other supported databases

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-system.git
   cd rbac-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with the following:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///rbac.db
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

6. **Access the app**:
   🌐 Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

## 📡 **API Endpoints**

### 🔑 **Authentication**
- **POST** `/register`:
  - Register a new user (default role: User).
- **POST** `/login`:
  - Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.

### 🛡️ **Role Management**
- **GET** `/roles`:
  - Retrieve all roles (Admin only).
- **POST** `/roles`:
  - Create a new role (Admin only).

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

- ✅ Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** to prevent plaintext storage.
- ✅ JWT tokens securely include user roles for efficient authorization.
- ✅ Access to resources is restricted using decorators (`@role_required`).

## 🌟 **Future Enhancements**

- 🗑️ Implement token blacklisting for logout functionality.
- 🛠️ Add fine-grained permissions (e.g., action-specific checks).
- 🚧 Include rate-limiting and CSRF protection for additional security.
